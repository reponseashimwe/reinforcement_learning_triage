# Dermatology Triage Clinic - Reinforcement Learning

A comprehensive reinforcement learning project implementing an intelligent medical triage system for a dermatology clinic. This project compares four state-of-the-art RL algorithms (DQN, PPO, A2C, REINFORCE) on a custom healthcare environment with multi-objective optimization.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of automated medical triage in a resource-constrained dermatology clinic. An RL agent learns to:

-   **Triage patients** based on symptom severity (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Critical)
-   **Manage resources** by dynamically opening/closing exam rooms
-   **Optimize wait times** while maintaining diagnostic accuracy
-   **Balance competing objectives** (accuracy, efficiency, cost)

### Key Features

-   **Custom Gymnasium Environment**: 15-dimensional observation space, 8 discrete actions
-   **Partial Observability**: Agent must infer severity from noisy symptoms
-   **Multi-Objective Rewards**: Balances triage accuracy, wait time, and resource costs
-   **Extensive Hyperparameter Tuning**: 40+ configurations across 4 algorithms
-   **Professional Visualization**: Pygame-based rendering with real-time metrics

## 📊 Results Summary

| Algorithm     | Mean Reward | Accuracy  | Convergence    | Best For                     |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **PPO**       | 683.91      | **99.6%** | ~150 episodes  | Healthcare (high accuracy)   |
| **REINFORCE** | **697.20**  | 40.74%    | ~300+ episodes | Exploration-heavy tasks      |
| **DQN**       | 649.90      | 32.31%    | ~200 episodes  | Multi-objective optimization |
| **A2C**       | 501.03      | 94.99%    | ~180 episodes  | Fast adaptation              |

**Winner**: PPO achieves the best balance with near-perfect triage accuracy (99.6%) and high reward.
